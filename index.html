                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>According to legend, Princess Libuše, the sovereign of the Czech tribe, married a humble ploughman by the name of
                    Přemysl and founded the dynasty carrying the same name. The legendary princess saw many prophecies from her castle
                    Libusin, which was located in central Bohemia.</p>
                    <p>In one prophecy, it is told, she foresaw the glory of
                    Prague. One day she had a vision: "I see a vast city, whose glory will touch the stars! I see a place in the middle of a
                    forest where a steep cliff rises above the Vltava River. There is a man, who is chiselling the threshold (prah) for the
                    house. A castle named Prague (Praha) will be built there.</p> 
                    <p>Just as the princes and the dukes stoop in front of a
                    threshold, they will bow to the castle and to the city around it. It will be honoured, favoured with great repute, and
                    praise will be bestowed upon it by the entire world."</p>

                    <h2>Fun facts</h2>
                    <p>1. It’s home to the largest castle in the world. Dating back to the ninth century, Prague Castle spans an impressive 18 acres and is home to stunning cathedrals, chapels, royal palaces and gorgeous ornamental gardens…</p>
                    <p>2. There is a graffiti wall devoted to John Lennon. Since 1980, it’s been repainted numerous times and is laced in graffiti lyrics from Lennon and The Beatles…</p>
                    <p>3. The Charles Bridge has some rather mathematical significance. Former Czech king Charles IV laid the first stone of
                    the bridge at precisely 5.31am on July 9, 1357. A superstitious man, the king was so into astrology and numerology that
                    he chose this date because of its written form: 1-3-5-7-9-7-5-3-1 (year, day, month, time). Bet you didn’t know that!</p>
